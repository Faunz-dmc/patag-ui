# Cross-platform JSON contract v1

Base: web `VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4100/api`; Android emulator `--dart-define=API_URL=http://10.0.2.2:4100/api`. The Android localhost address points at Android itself. For physical devices use a reachable development endpoint; the service intentionally binds loopback, so prefer `adb reverse tcp:4100 tcp:4100` and API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:4100/api for a USB-connected device. Tokens are memory-only on Android and sessionStorage on web. Restarting the API invalidates all sessions.

`Authorization: Bearer <token>` is required except registration, login, recovery, public map, health and evidence URLs. Passwordless demo endpoints are permanently removed and return 404. Role and ownership checks occur again in the mock API. Error body: `{ "error": "Human readable message" }`; 400 validation, 401 expired session, 403 ownership/role, 404 missing record, 409 invalid workflow transition, 413 oversize body.

## Models

- User: id, name, email, role (citizen/admin/maintenance), active, optional teamId. Citizen and LGUPersonnel constrain role. Password hashes/salts never leave the service.
- MaintenanceTeam: id, name, members[], active.
- Coordinates: lat and lng, finite numeric degrees, ranges -90..90 / -180..180.
- LocationDetails: road, barangay, city, province, landmark, coordinates.
- Severity: Low, Medium, High. These are citizen-reported estimates.
- ReportStatus: Submitted, Under Review, Verified, Assigned, In Progress, Resolved, Rejected, Duplicate. Canonical order is held separately in Dart and TypeScript.
- PotholeReport: id, title, description, hazards, severity, status, location, photos[], reporterId, jurisdiction, createdAt, updatedAt, teamId, assignment, history[], updates[], completion, feedback, flagged, optional duplicateOf.
- ReportPhoto: id, url, name, kind (before/after), optional demo. Real uploaded photo URLs are `/uploads/<uuid>.<png|jpg|webp>`. Resolve relative URLs under the configured API base. Seed SVG illustrations are explicitly marked demo and cannot be supplied as new citizen/completion evidence.
- ReportHistoryEntry: id, at (ISO UTC), actor, action, from (nullable), to, note.
- Assignment: teamId, priority, note, targetDate (nullable ISO date), at.
- RepairProgressUpdate: at, phase, note, photos[].
- RepairDocumentation: before[], after[], note. Before references original citizen evidence; after is newly uploaded.
- CompletionVerification: state (Awaiting Verification / Additional Work Requested / Verified), note, photos[], at. Its state is separate from report status.
- Notification: id, role, optional userId/teamId, reportId, title, at, read.
- ReportFeedback: rating 1..5, text, at. Once only and owner only after Resolved.
- DuplicateCandidate: report (privacy-safe record), distance (integer metres). Same road and <=150 m haversine heuristic, never automatic merging.
- AgencyJurisdiction: id/name/municipalities in domain definitions. The mock report stores a jurisdiction label and forwarding updates this label; a real agency directory and routing service are integration requirements.

## Create example

```json
{"title":"Damaged outer lane","description":"Pothole beside the crossing.","hazards":"Water collects after rain.","severity":"High","photos":[{"id":"upload-id","url":"/uploads/uuid.png","name":"road.png","kind":"before"}],"location":{"road":"Test Road","barangay":"Guinhawa","city":"Malolos","province":"Bulacan","landmark":"Waiting shed","coordinates":{"lat":14.852,"lng":120.811}}}
```

Maintenance can also send `before-photos` with uploaded `photos` while Assigned or In Progress (except while awaiting verification); original evidence is retained.

## Event examples

```json
{"action":"review","note":"Checking location and photo."}
{"action":"verify","note":"Location and damage confirmed."}
{"action":"reject","note":"Evidence does not show road damage."}
{"action":"flag","note":"Please inspect the exact road section."}
{"action":"duplicate","duplicateOf":"PTG-2026-0102","note":"Same damage confirmed."}
{"action":"forward","jurisdiction":"Responsible road agency","note":"Jurisdiction review required."}
{"action":"assign","teamId":"team-1","priority":"High","targetDate":"2026-10-26","note":"Inspect the outer lane."}
{"action":"start","note":"Crew arrived on site."}
{"action":"progress","phase":"Repair","note":"Base prepared.","photos":[]}
{"action":"complete","note":"Patch compacted and road cleared.","photos":[{"id":"upload-id","url":"/uploads/uuid.png","name":"after.png","kind":"after"}]}
{"action":"return","note":"Please inspect the patch edge."}
{"action":"resolve","note":"Completion evidence verified."}
```

CSV/PDF exports are generated in the admin frontend from its authorized report snapshot, not by an export server endpoint. Production should provide a server-authorized export endpoint with filters, audit and file retention. In-app notifications are polling-based mock events; there is no push/email transport. JSON fixtures demonstrate one jurisdiction and two teams; there is no production LGU directory.

## Connected workspace operations (24 October)

- Bootstrap now includes shared `settings: {agency, city, province}`, dynamic `teams`, and `demo: true` in the local demonstration service.
- Admin `PATCH /settings` validates and saves shared agency/city/province. New reports inherit the configured agency.
- Admin `POST /teams` creates a team; `PATCH /teams` edits its name/active state. Teams with active members or open work cannot be deactivated.
- Admin `POST /users` takes name/email/password/role/teamId and creates an account. Maintenance roles require an active team. `PATCH /users` also updates team membership. Password material is never returned by these endpoints.
- Passwordless demo authentication and account discovery are removed. `/auth/demo` and `/auth/demo/accounts` return 404 regardless of legacy enable flags.
- Admin report event `{action:"publication", approved:true|false}` controls public photo visibility. New before/after evidence clears approval. Original photos remain available to authorized roles. This is a publication workflow, not automatic face/plate redaction or secure object-storage authorization.

## Authentication follow-up

Citizen signup now requires name (1–100 characters), normalized email (maximum 254), private address (barangay, city or municipality, province; optional street/house number), and a password of 15–128 characters; the same creation policy applies to staff provisioning. Optional `role` on `/auth/login` must match the account. `/auth/register` ignores role/team/active injection and always creates an active citizen with `emailVerified:false`.

Sessions expire after eight hours and are revoked on logout or password changes. Tokens issued before demo removal are rejected; users must sign in again once. Registration/login are limited to 20 requests per minute per client/endpoint in the Node service. Demo endpoints are permanently removed. Seeded accounts without passwords cannot authenticate; provisioning or changing a password revokes prior sessions. `/me` allows the citizen to correct the private address with the same validation. It cannot change email without a verified recovery workflow. See `docs/auth-flow/README.md` for preview boundaries and test evidence.


## Admin crew membership editing

The PostgreSQL API accepts `POST /teams` with `{name, active?, memberIds?}` and `PATCH /teams` with `{id, name, active?, memberIds?}`. Both require an active admin session. `memberIds` is an optional array of unique active maintenance-account IDs (maximum 1,000), sourced from the admin's authoritative `/bootstrap.users`. Team `members` remains a display-name array for existing clients; select and save by account ID, never name.

Providing IDs replaces the team's active membership atomically with its metadata. Selecting an account transfers it from its previous team; removing it leaves the account unassigned, with no team report/notification access. Inactive account links are preserved. Omitting `memberIds` preserves existing memberships. Nonexistent, inactive, non-maintenance, duplicate or malformed selections return 400. An inactive target cannot receive members; open work still prevents deactivation (409). Account edits share the membership transaction locks to avoid restoring stale links.

Local migration `002_unassigned_crew.sql` removes only the `maintenance_has_team` constraint from the current v1 schema. Existing accounts, teams, report assignments, and foreign keys remain. New maintenance accounts still require an active team; existing removed accounts can be edited or reassigned. The original `202610270001_admin.sql` has now been recovered byte-for-byte in `backend/legacy/`; its SHA-256 matches the live legacy ledger. A read-only check on 3 November 2026 confirmed that the configured database already records both current migrations, alongside the preserved legacy schema. No hosted upgrade was needed or performed for this repair.

Startup, migration, seed, and admin provisioning validate migration lineage before migration writes. A recognized current baseline may coexist with the exact recovered legacy ledger; legacy-only schemas, missing current baseline tables, unknown migration histories, and changed or additional legacy records are rejected. Run `npm --prefix backend run check:migrations` for a read-only diagnosis. The recovered SQL is an immutable reference, never replayed by the current runner. Neither ledger is rewritten, and legacy profiles are not merged into current authentication. See [migration recovery and verification](migration-recovery.md) for scope and evidence; full hosted flow acceptance, Storage setup, and deployment are separate from this check.
